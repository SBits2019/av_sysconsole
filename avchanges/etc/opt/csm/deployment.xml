    <!--
        This section specifies the fixedStreams to be played when CSM is running.
        Please refer to the documentation on how to configure CSM and LSM to enable fixedStream support.

        A fixedStream has the following configuration settings:

        clientId
            A reference to a specific client in devices.xml. The client reference should define
            at least UDP transport with allocateResources=false. Depending on program and destination
            requirements, this may contain other optional settings.
            This is an optional setting and defaults to fixedStreamClient.
        program
            A reference to a specific program to be played as a fixed stream.
            Mandatory setting, no default.
        targetIp
            Destination IP address for a fixed stream.
            Mandatory setting, no default
        targetPort
            A destination port address for a fixed stream.
            Mandatory setting, no default
        sgid
            Service group to use for this stream. This is used for stitcher selection.
            This requires clusterSelect set to "sgid" in the DownstreamPlugin settings in csm.xml.
            This is an optional setting, no default.
        clusterId
            Cluster id to use for this stream. This is used for stitcher selection.
            This requires clusterSelect set to "clusterId" in the DownstreamPlugin settings in csm.xml.
            This is an optional setting, no default.
        restart
            Automatically restart the stream if it was stopped. This option is ignored if
            the stop was triggered by an administrative termination of the session.
            This is an optional setting and defaults to true.
